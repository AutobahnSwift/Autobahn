Autobahn is a set of tools (written in Swift) heavily inspired by [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) to automate many day to day tasks associated with development of apps in the Apple ecosystem.  Currently most progess has been made on a sub package called [Shuttle](/Shuttle.md) that is basically a port of fastlane's [spaceship](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/spaceship) which is an HTTP client for interacting with the Apple Developer portal and iTunesConnect.
